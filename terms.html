            </div>
            
            <div class="terms-point">
                <h4>7. Property Access</h4>
                <p>By scheduling services, you authorize our personnel to access designated property areas during service windows. You're responsible for securing pets and notifying us of access restrictions. We're not liable for pre-existing property conditions.

                <h4>11. Service Limitations</h4>
                <p>Our services have natural limitations based on environmental factors we can't control. Irrigation effectiveness depends on proper installation, maintenance, and local conditions. We don't guarantee specific plant growth results. Services may be unavailable due to maintenance, outages, or other factors. Some areas may have limited service availability.

                <h4>12. Third-Party Services</h4>
                <p>Our services may integrate with or require third-party services like payment processors. We're not responsible for third-party services' performance or terms. Use of third-party services is at your own risk. Some integrations may require you to accept additional terms. We don't endorse or guarantee third-party services. Issues with third-party services should be resolved directly with the provider. We may discontinue integrations at any time. Data shared with third parties is governed by their privacy policies, not ours.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="terms-point">
                <h4>13. Warranties and Disclaimers</h4>
                <p>Services are provided "as is" without warranties except as expressly stated. We disclaim all implied warranties including merchantability and fitness for purpose. We don't warrant services will be uninterrupted or error-free. Some jurisdictions don't allow warranty exclusions, so some may not apply to you. Product warranties are provided by manufacturers and may require registration. Service warranties are outlined in service agreements. Our liability is limited as permitted by law. You assume all risks associated with service use.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="terms-point">
                <h4>14. Limitation of Liability</h4>
                <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, we're not liable for indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from service use. Our total liability for any claim is limited to fees you paid for the relevant services. Some jurisdictions don't allow liability limitations, so these may not apply to you. We're not liable for events beyond our reasonable control. Claims must be filed within one year of the incident. This limitation applies even if we've been advised of potential damages. Professional advice should be sought for important decisions.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="terms-point">
                <h4>15. Indemnification</h4>
                <p>You agree to indemnify and hold harmless AquaMistroot and its affiliates from claims arising from your breach of these Terms, misuse of services, or violation of laws. This includes legal fees and damages. We'll notify you of any claim requiring indemnification and cooperate in your defense. You may not settle any claim that imposes obligations on us without our consent. Our failure to enforce this right doesn't waive it. This indemnification survives termination of these Terms. You're responsible for losses caused by those accessing services through your account.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="terms-point">
                <h4>16. Termination</h4>
                <p>We may terminate or suspend your access to services immediately for breach of these Terms without notice. You may stop using our services anytime. Upon termination: your right to use services ceases, you must pay outstanding fees, and we may delete your data as permitted by law. Some provisions survive termination including intellectual property, disclaimers, and limitations of liability. We're not liable for termination's consequences. Service contracts may have specific termination provisions that supplement these Terms. Reactivation after termination may require fees.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="terms-point">
                <h4>17. Dispute Resolution</h4>
                <p>Most disputes can be resolved by contacting customer service. If unresolved, disputes shall be resolved through binding arbitration under AAA rules, with hearings in New York, NY. Class actions and jury trials are waived. Small claims may be brought in your local jurisdiction. The prevailing party may recover legal fees. Claims must be filed within one year of the incident. Some jurisdictions limit arbitration requirements, so this may not apply to you. These Terms are governed by New York law without regard to conflict of law provisions.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="terms-point">
                <h4>18. Force Majeure</h4>
                <p>We're not liable for failure to perform due to events beyond our reasonable control including natural disasters, wars, terrorism, riots, embargoes, acts of civil or military authorities, fires, floods, accidents, strikes, shortages, or utility failures ("Force Majeure"). During Force Majeure events, our obligations are suspended. We'll make reasonable efforts to notify you of service disruptions. If Force Majeure lasts over 30 days, either party may terminate affected services without penalty. This provision doesn't excuse payment obligations for services already rendered.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="terms-point">
                <h4>19. Changes to Terms</h4>
                <p>We may modify these Terms at any time by posting updated versions on our website. Material changes will be notified via email or website notice 30 days before taking effect. Your continued use after changes constitutes acceptance. It's your responsibility to review Terms periodically. The "Last Updated" date indicates when changes were made. Archived versions are available upon request. If you don't agree to changes, you must stop using our services. Service-specific terms may be updated separately with appropriate notice.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="terms-point">
                <h4>20. Entire Agreement</h4>
                <p>These Terms, with our Privacy Policy and any service-specific terms, constitute the entire agreement regarding our services, superseding prior agreements. If any provision is found invalid, the remainder remains enforceable. Our failure to enforce any right doesn't waive it. You may not assign these Terms without our consent; we may assign them freely. Notices must be in writing and sent to our corporate address. Headings are for convenience only. The parties are independent contractors. No third party has rights under these Terms.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="terms-point">
                <h4>21. Service Guarantees</h4>
                <p>Our services come with a 90-day workmanship guarantee covering defects in installation. Product warranties are provided by manufacturers. Guarantees require proper maintenance and don't cover damage from misuse, neglect, or external factors. Claims must be made in writing within the guarantee period. We'll repair or re-perform guaranteed services at our discretion. Some exclusions apply as detailed in service agreements. Guarantees are void if unauthorized modifications are made. Extended warranties may be available for purchase. This is your sole remedy for guaranteed issues.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="terms-point">
                <h4>22. Maintenance Requirements</h4>
                <p>Proper system maintenance is essential for optimal performance. Clients are responsible for routine maintenance like nozzle cleaning and seasonal adjustments unless under maintenance contracts. Winterization may be required in cold climates. We offer maintenance services that include periodic inspections and adjustments. Failure to perform recommended maintenance may void warranties. Maintenance schedules vary by system type and local conditions. We provide maintenance guidelines with each installation. Neglect may lead to reduced efficiency and premature system failure.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="terms-point">
                <h4>23. Water Usage</h4>
                <p>Our systems are designed for water efficiency but actual usage depends on configuration, runtime, and local conditions. We're not responsible for water bills or restrictions in your area. Clients should monitor local water regulations. Some systems include water-saving features that can be adjusted. Proper scheduling maximizes efficiency. We recommend using rain sensors where available. Water pressure variations may affect performance. Leaks should be reported immediately. Conservation is encouragedâwe can help optimize settings for efficiency.</p>
            </div>

                <h4>24. System Monitoring</h4>
                <p>Some systems include remote monitoring capabilities. By using these features, you consent to data collection about system performance. Monitoring helps identify issues early but doesn't replace regular maintenance. You're responsible for responding to alerts. Monitoring services may require additional fees. Data is used to improve services and may be aggregated for research. Some systems allow third-party integrationsâreview those services' terms separately. We're not liable for monitoring service interruptions. You may disable monitoring features but this may limit functionality.</p>

                <h4>25. Professional Installation</h4>
                <p>Our systems require professional installation for proper function and warranty coverage. DIY installation voids warranties and may create hazards. Our technicians are trained and certified for safe installation. Installation includes site assessment, system design, and testing. Some sites may require modifications before installation. Installation timelines vary by project complexity. We coordinate with other trades when needed. Permits may be requiredâwe'll advise but you're responsible for obtaining them. Installation fees are separate from equipment costs.</p>

                <p>Our systems are designed to work with specified components. Using incompatible parts may void warranties and reduce performance. We can't guarantee third-party product compatibility. Recommended replacement parts are available through us. Modifications should only be made by authorized technicians. Some systems require specific water qualityâwe'll advise on pretreatment if needed. Compatibility issues should be reported immediately. Retrofit kits may be available for older systems. Performance may vary with non-standard configurations.</p>

                <p>Our systems must be used according to safety guidelines provided. Electrical components should only be serviced by qualified personnel. Keep systems clear of obstructions. Report damage immediately. Some maintenance tasks require system shutdown. Safety gear may be needed for certain proceduresâwe'll provide guidance. Children and pets should be supervised near operating systems. Winter precautions prevent freeze damage. Proper grounding is essential for electrical safety. We're not liable for injuries from misuse or unauthorized modifications.</p>

                <h4>28. Environmental Compliance</h4>
                <p>Our systems are designed to meet environmental regulations where installed. You're responsible for complying with local water use rules. Some areas restrict irrigation times or require permits. We'll advise on known regulations but you should verify current requirements. Rain sensors or moisture meters may be mandated in your area. Backflow prevention devices are often requiredâwe include these where needed. Report any environmental concerns immediately. We strive to minimize our ecological impact through water-efficient designs.</p>

Non-emergency issues are scheduled during normal hours. Define what constitutes an emergency (e.g., major leaks, electrical hazards). We prioritize emergencies but response times vary. Temporary fixes may be applied until full repairs can be made. Have your system information ready when reporting emergencies. Some emergencies may require utility company involvement. Regular maintenance reduces emergency occurrences.</p>

                <h4>36. Project Delays</h4>
                <p>While we strive to meet projected timelines, some delays are unavoidable due to weather, material availability, or unforeseen site conditions. We'll communicate delays promptly and work to minimize impacts. Delay claims must account for reasonable contingencies. We're not liable for consequential damages from delays.

                <p>Changes to project scope require written change orders signed by both parties. Verbal change requests aren't binding. Change orders detail cost and schedule impacts. Work shouldn't proceed on changes without approved orders. Small changes may be documented via email. Disputed changes should be resolved before work continues. Emergency changes will be documented afterward. We reserve the right to charge for change order preparation. Some contracts limit change order frequency. Clear communication prevents change order disputes.</p>
