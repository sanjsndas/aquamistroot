            <h2>Our Commitment to Your Privacy</h2>
            <p>At AquaMistroot Garden Services, we are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring the security of your personal information. This comprehensive Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you visit our website or use our services.</p>
            
            <div class="privacy-point">
                <h4>1. Information Collection Methods</h4>
                <p>We collect information through various methods including direct interactions when you fill out forms on our website, automated technologies like cookies when you browse our site, and third-party sources such as social media platforms. The data collected may include personal identifiers like your name, contact details, and payment information. We also gather technical data such as IP addresses, browser types, and device information to improve our website functionality. Collection occurs when you register for services, make purchases, or interact with our customer support team.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="privacy-point">
                <h4>2. Types of Personal Data Collected</h4>
                <p>The personal data we collect includes identity data (name, username, marital status), contact data (address, email, phone numbers), financial data (payment card details), transaction data (purchase history), technical data (IP address, login data), profile data (username and password), usage data (how you use our site), and marketing preferences. We may also collect sensitive data like health information relevant to garden accessibility needs. For service delivery, we collect property details and gardening preferences to provide customized solutions.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="privacy-point">
                <h4>3. Purpose of Data Collection</h4>
                <p>We collect your personal data primarily to provide and improve our services, process transactions, and manage your account. The data helps us personalize your experience, recommend suitable gardening solutions, and provide effective customer support. We use information to analyze website performance, develop new services, and conduct market research. Your data enables us to send service-related communications, administer promotions, and comply with legal obligations. Collection purposes include fraud prevention, network security, and business administration.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="privacy-point">
                <h4>4. Legal Basis for Processing</h4>
                <p>We process your personal data based on several legal grounds including your consent when you voluntarily provide information, contractual necessity when processing is required to fulfill our services, and legitimate interests where processing benefits our business operations without overriding your rights. Legal compliance forms another basis when we're obligated to process data by law. In rare cases involving vital interests, we may process data to protect someone's life. We ensure all processing activities are justified under at least one lawful basis under GDPR and other applicable regulations.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="privacy-point">
                <h4>5. Data Sharing Practices</h4>
                <p>We may share your information with trusted third-party service providers who assist in operating our website, conducting business, or servicing you, as long as they agree to keep it confidential. Data may be shared with payment processors, delivery services, marketing platforms, and IT service providers. In business transfers like mergers or acquisitions, customer information may be among transferred assets. We disclose data when required by law or to protect our rights, property, or safety. International transfers follow adequate protection measures when data crosses borders.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="privacy-point">
                <h4>6. International Data Transfers</h4>
                <p>As an international company, we may transfer, store, and process your information outside your country of residence, including to the United States where our servers are located. When transferring EU/UK data internationally, we implement appropriate safeguards like Standard Contractual Clauses or Privacy Shield frameworks. We ensure all transfers comply with applicable data protection laws and provide equivalent protection as required in your jurisdiction. You can request information about specific transfer mechanisms we use for your data by contacting our privacy officer.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="privacy-point">
                <h4>7. Data Security Measures</h4>
                <p>We implement robust security measures including encryption, access controls, and regular security assessments to protect your personal data. Our technical safeguards include firewalls, data encryption, and secure socket layer technology. Organizational measures involve staff training, confidentiality agreements, and limited access to personal data. We regularly test our systems for vulnerabilities and update our security protocols. While we strive to protect your information, no internet transmission is completely secure, so we cannot guarantee absolute security but we commit to promptly addressing any breaches.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="privacy-point">
                <h4>8. Data Retention Periods</h4>
                <p>We retain personal data only as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes we collected it for, including legal, accounting, or reporting requirements. Customer account data is typically retained for seven years after last activity for tax and legal purposes. Transaction data is kept for ten years to comply with financial regulations. Marketing data is retained until you unsubscribe or after two years of inactivity. Technical data may be stored in anonymized form for analytics. We periodically review our retention periods and securely delete data that's no longer needed.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="privacy-point">
                <h4>9. Your Privacy Rights</h4>
                <p>Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have rights including access to your data, correction of inaccuracies, erasure in certain circumstances, restriction of processing, data portability, objection to processing, and withdrawal of consent. You can exercise these rights by contacting us, though some rights may be limited by legal requirements. We may need to verify your identity before processing requests. There's typically no fee for accessing your data, though we may charge for excessive or unfounded requests. We respond to all legitimate requests within one month.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="privacy-point">
                <h4>10. Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h4>
                <p>Our website uses cookies and similar tracking technologies to distinguish you from other users, enhance your experience, and analyze site traffic. Cookies are small data files stored on your device that help us remember your preferences. We use session cookies (temporary) and persistent cookies (remain until deleted). Third-party cookies from services like Google Analytics help us understand user behavior. You can control cookies through browser settings, though disabling them may affect website functionality. Our Cookie Policy provides detailed information about specific cookies we use and their purposes.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="privacy-point">
                <h4>11. Third-Party Links</h4>
                <p>Our website may contain links to third-party websites, plugins, and applications that are not operated by us. Clicking on these links may allow third parties to collect or share data about you. We don't control these sites and aren't responsible for their privacy practices. We encourage you to review the privacy policy of every site you visit. This policy applies only to information collected by our website. Our inclusion of third-party links doesn't imply endorsement of their privacy practices. We disclaim liability for third-party actions.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="privacy-point">
                <h4>12. Children's Privacy</h4>
                <p>Our services are not directed to individuals under the age of 16, and we don't knowingly collect personal information from children without parental consent. If we discover we've collected data from a child without verification of parental consent, we'll delete that information immediately. Parents or guardians can contact us to review, delete, or restrict processing of their child's information. We support parental control tools and encourage parents to monitor their children's online activities. Our marketing materials are designed to appeal to adult audiences only.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="privacy-point">
                <h4>13. Marketing Communications</h4>
                <p>We may use your personal data to send you marketing communications about our services, promotions, and gardening tips, but only with your consent or where permitted by law. You can opt out of marketing at any time by clicking unsubscribe links in emails or contacting us. Even if you opt out, you'll still receive service-related communications. We don't share your contact details with third parties for their marketing purposes without explicit consent. Our marketing communications include clear identification that they're from AquaMistroot and provide easy opt-out methods.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="privacy-point">
                <h4>14. Automated Decision Making</h4>
                <p>We may use automated processing and profiling to analyze customer preferences, predict gardening needs, and personalize service recommendations. These automated systems help us efficiently match customers with appropriate irrigation solutions based on their garden characteristics. You have the right not to be subject to solely automated decisions that significantly affect you, unless necessary for contract fulfillment or authorized by law. In such cases, you can request human intervention, express your views, or contest the decision. We ensure transparency about any profiling activities.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="privacy-point">
                <h4>15. Business Transfers</h4>
                <p>In the event of a merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy, or sale of company assets, your personal information may be transferred as part of the transaction. We'll notify you via email and/or prominent website notice of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have. The receiving party would be required to honor our privacy commitments. Your data would remain protected under this Privacy Policy until you're notified of any changes. We require acquiring parties to maintain comparable privacy standards.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="privacy-point">
                <h4>16. Data Breach Procedures</h4>
                <p>We have established protocols to detect, report, and investigate personal data breaches. In case of a breach likely to result in risk to your rights, we'll notify you and relevant authorities within 72 hours of discovery, as required by law. Our response plan includes containment, assessment, notification, and review phases to prevent recurrence. We maintain detailed records of all breaches regardless of whether notification is required. You can help protect your information by using strong passwords, keeping login details confidential, and alerting us to any suspicious activity.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="privacy-point">
                <h4>17. California Privacy Rights</h4>
                <p>California residents have specific rights under the CCPA including the right to know what personal information is collected, used, shared, or sold, and the right to delete personal information held by businesses. You can opt out of the sale of personal information and not face discrimination for exercising privacy rights. We don't sell customer data, but California residents may still request disclosure of data collection practices and categories of information collected. Authorized agents can make requests on behalf of consumers when properly verified.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="privacy-point">
                <h4>18. GDPR Compliance</h4>
                <p>For EU/UK residents, we comply with General Data Protection Regulation requirements including lawful processing, data minimization, and accountability principles. We've appointed a Data Protection Officer to oversee compliance and serve as a contact point for data subjects and supervisory authorities. Our data processing agreements with vendors include GDPR-mandated clauses. We conduct Data Protection Impact Assessments for high-risk processing activities. EU/UK residents have additional rights including lodging complaints with their national Data Protection Authority if they believe their rights have been violated.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="privacy-point">
                <h4>19. Do Not Track Signals</h4>
                <p>Our website currently doesn't respond to Do Not Track (DNT) browser signals as no industry standard for DNT has been established. We await the development of technological solutions that would allow us to honor such signals effectively. In the meantime, you can manage tracking through cookie settings in your browser or by using privacy-focused browser extensions. Some third-party services we use may honor DNT signals, but we can't control their practices. We're monitoring developments in DNT technology and will update our practices as standards emerge.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="privacy-point">
                <h4>20. Social Media Features</h4>
                <p>Our website includes social media features like Facebook "Like" buttons and Twitter "Tweet" buttons that may collect your IP address and set cookies. These features are either hosted by third parties or directly on our site. Your interactions are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing the feature, not by this policy. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any social media platforms you use. Social media plugins may track your browsing even if you don't click them, depending on your social media account settings.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="privacy-point">
                <h4>21. Public Forums and Reviews</h4>
                <p>Our website may offer publicly accessible blogs, community forums, or customer review sections. Any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others. We're not responsible for personal information you choose to submit publicly. To request removal from our blog or community forum, contact us. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your information, in which case we'll let you know why.

            <div class="privacy-point">
                <h4>22. Employment Applications</h4>
                <p>If you apply for employment, we collect additional information including employment history, education, skills, references, and possibly sensitive data like disability status for equal opportunity monitoring. Applicant data is used solely for recruitment purposes and is retained for two years unless you request deletion. We may share applicant information with background check providers with consent. Unsuccessful applicants may be considered for future positions unless they opt out. Employees and contractors are subject to separate privacy notices regarding workplace data collection.</p>

                <p>We engage carefully vetted third-party companies to perform functions like payment processing, data analysis, marketing assistance, customer service, and hosting. These providers have access to personal information needed to perform their functions but may not use it for other purposes. Our contracts require them to maintain confidentiality and implement appropriate security measures. We conduct due diligence on all service providers and periodically audit their compliance. Sub-processors are listed in our Data Processing Agreement available upon request by data subjects.</p>

                <h4>24. Data Accuracy</h4>
                <p>We strive to maintain accurate, complete, and up-to-date personal information. You can help by promptly notifying us of any changes to your information. We provide mechanisms to review and update your account details through our website or by contacting customer service. In some cases, we may need to verify new information before updating records. We take reasonable steps to ensure data quality when collecting information directly from you or from third parties. Periodic data cleansing exercises help maintain database accuracy.</p>

                <h4>25. Anonymized Data</h4>
                <p>We may create anonymized data sets from personal information by removing identifying components. This anonymized data, which can't reasonably identify individuals, may be used for research, analytics, and improving our services. We may share aggregated demographic information with partners that doesn't identify any individual. Anonymization follows industry standards to prevent re-identification. Such data falls outside privacy regulations and may be retained indefinitely. We use anonymized data to understand customer trends and enhance our product offerings.</p>

            <div class="privacy-point">
                <h4>26. Financial Information</h4>
                <p>All financial transactions are processed through PCI-DSS compliant payment processors. We don't store full credit card numbers on our servers—only the last four digits and expiration date for reference. Payment data is encrypted during transmission using SSL technology. For recurring payments, tokenization replaces sensitive data with unique identifiers. You should never send full payment details via email. We retain financial records as required by tax laws but minimize storage of sensitive financial data. Report any suspicious payment requests immediately.</p>

            <div class="privacy-point">
                <h4>27. System Logs</h4>
                <p>Our servers automatically record information including your IP address, browser type, referring/exit pages, and operating system for system administration and security purposes. These logs don't typically contain personal information unless voluntarily provided through forms. Log data helps diagnose technical issues, analyze trends, and prevent fraud. We retain server logs for 90 days unless needed for investigations. Logs may be shared with law enforcement when legally required. Access to system logs is restricted to authorized IT personnel.</p>

            <div class="privacy-point">
                <h4>28. Single Sign-On</h4>
                <p>If you choose to register or log in using third-party credentials (like Google or Facebook), we'll receive certain profile information from those services based on your privacy settings there. This may include your name, email, and profile picture. We don't receive or store passwords for third-party accounts. You can disconnect the connection in both our service and the third-party application. Using SSO may share information about your use of our site with the provider—review their privacy policies for details.</p>

            <div class="privacy-point">
                <h4>29. Location Data</h4>
                <p>For service delivery purposes, we collect property location data necessary for installation and maintenance of irrigation systems. Our mobile app may request access to your device's precise location to provide localized gardening advice, but this is optional. Website analytics include generalized geographic data based on IP addresses. You can disable location services in device settings, though this may limit certain features. Location history is retained only as long as needed for service provision unless you consent to longer retention for personalized services.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="privacy-point">
                <h4>30. Email Security</h4>
                <p>Regular email isn't a secure communication method, so we advise against sending sensitive information via email. Our customer service team uses secure portals for sensitive communications. We implement email filtering to detect phishing attempts and malware. Official emails from us will always come from @aquamistroot.com domains. Be cautious of emails requesting passwords or payment details—we'll never ask for these via email. Report suspicious emails to our security team for investigation. Our staff receives regular training on secure email practices.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="privacy-point">
                <h4>31. Customer Testimonials</h4>
                <p>With your consent, we may display personal testimonials along with names and photos on our website. You can request updates or removal of your testimonial at any time. Testimonials may be edited for clarity or length while preserving the original meaning. We never pay for or fabricate testimonials. Before publishing, we verify that testimonials reflect genuine customer experiences. Testimonials are considered marketing materials and may be used across various platforms unless you specify restrictions. Anonymous testimonials may use first names or initials only.</p>

            <div class="privacy-point">
                <h4>32. Affiliate Programs</h4>
                <p>If you participate in our affiliate or referral programs, we track referral links to properly credit commissions. This involves storing identifiers linking you to referred customers. Affiliates receive reports showing aggregate conversion metrics but not individual customer details unless the customer identifies themselves. We require affiliates to maintain their own privacy policies compliant with applicable laws. Fraudulent referral activity may result in termination from the program and forfeiture of commissions. Affiliates must disclose their relationship with us when making recommendations.</p>

            <div class="privacy-point">
                <h4>33. Video Surveillance</h4>
                <p>For security purposes, our physical locations may use video surveillance in public areas. Signs notify visitors of camera presence. Recordings are stored securely for up to 30 days unless needed for investigations. Access is restricted to authorized security personnel. We don't use facial recognition technology. Employees are informed about surveillance during onboarding. Cameras aren't placed in private areas like restrooms. Visitors requesting copies of footage featuring themselves must provide sufficient identification and specify date/time of visit.</p>

                <h4>34. Data Protection Officer</h4>
                <p>We've appointed a Data Protection Officer (DPO) to oversee compliance with data protection laws. The DPO monitors internal compliance, provides training, and serves as a contact point for data subjects and supervisory authorities. You can contact our DPO at dpo@aquamistroot.com for privacy-related inquiries or concerns. The DPO maintains independence in performing duties and reports directly to senior management. All employees know how to escalate privacy concerns to the DPO. The DPO conducts regular privacy audits and impact assessments for high-risk processing activities.</p>

                <h4>35. Policy Updates</h4>
                <p>We may update this Privacy Policy periodically to reflect changes in practices, services, or legal requirements. The "Last Updated" date at the top indicates when revisions were made. Material changes will be communicated through email or website notices before taking effect. Continued use of our services after updates constitutes acceptance of the revised policy. We archive previous versions for reference. Customers can request version comparisons to understand changes. Significant changes affecting data subject rights may require renewed consent in some jurisdictions.</p>

                <h4>36. Dispute Resolution</h4>
                <p>If you have concerns about our privacy practices, please contact us first to seek resolution. For EU/UK residents, you may lodge complaints with your national Data Protection Authority. U.S. residents may contact state Attorneys General or the FTC. We participate in independent dispute resolution through the BBB and other applicable programs. Arbitration may be required for certain disputes as outlined in our Terms of Service. We commit to working in good faith to resolve privacy complaints amicably and promptly.</p>

                <h4>37. Whistleblower Protections</h4>
                <p>Employees and contractors who report privacy violations or security concerns in good faith are protected from retaliation under our whistleblower policy. Reports can be made anonymously through our ethics hotline. We investigate all reports promptly and confidentially. Whistleblowers may be eligible for rewards when reports lead to significant improvements. Third parties like vendors can also report concerns without fear of adverse consequences. Our compliance team oversees investigations and implements corrective actions when needed.</p>

            <div class="privacy-point">
                <h4>38. Industry Standards</h4>
                <p>Our privacy practices align with industry standards and frameworks including ISO 27001 for information security and NIST guidelines for data protection. We participate in privacy seal programs when applicable to our services. Our security controls are regularly assessed against evolving threats. Staff receive ongoing training on emerging privacy requirements. We benchmark our practices against similar companies to identify improvement opportunities. Industry associations help us stay informed about best practices in data protection and customer privacy.</p>

                <h4>39. Special Categories of Data</h4>
                <p>We generally avoid collecting sensitive data like health information unless necessary for service provision (e.g., accessibility requirements for garden installations). Such data receives enhanced protections including additional encryption and access restrictions. Processing special category data requires explicit consent or other lawful bases under applicable laws. You can withdraw consent for processing sensitive data at any time. We minimize collection and retention of special category data, deleting it when no longer needed for the specified purpose.</p>
