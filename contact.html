                    <p>Basic maintenance includes seasonal start-up/shut-down, monthly visual inspections, nozzle cleaning, and adjusting schedules as plants mature. Annual professional service should check pressure, coverage, leaks, and controller function. Backflow devices require annual testing in many areas. Winterization is critical in cold climates. After storms, check for damage. Monitor water bills for unexpected increases indicating leaks. We provide customized maintenance checklists for each system. Neglecting maintenance leads to water waste, high repair costs, and plant stress. Proper care extends system life 10-15 years.</p>

                    <p>Smart controllers use local weather data and property-specific parameters to automatically adjust watering. They connect to WiFi to access forecasts and can be controlled via smartphone apps. Soil moisture sensors provide real-time ground conditions. Advanced models learn your landscape's needs over time. Watering is skipped during rain and increased during heat waves. Usage data helps identify leaks or inefficiencies. We program them with your plant types, sun exposure, and soil conditions. Most pay for themselves in water savings within 2-3 years while improving plant health.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>For installations over $2,000, we offer financing through third-party lenders with approved credit. Typical terms are 6-60 months with fixed rates. A 50% deposit is required to schedule work, with the balance due upon completion. Commercial accounts may qualify for net-30 terms. Seasonal payment plans spread costs over several months. Some water conservation upgrades qualify for on-bill financing through utilities. We accept HSA/FSA payments for therapeutic landscape installations.

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Yes, we service all brands and types of irrigation systems, regardless of original installer. However, we can't warranty others' work and may need to modify non-standard installations for proper repair. Older or poorly installed systems may require upgrades for reliable operation. We'll provide an honest assessment of repair versus replacement options. Documentation of the original design helps with troubleshooting. Some proprietary systems have limited serviceability. We'll always recommend the most cost-effective solution for your situation.</p>

                    <span>+</span>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Signs of leaks include soggy areas when system is off, unexplained high water bills, low pressure, or constantly running pumps. Smart controllers with flow monitoring alert you to abnormal usage. Annual pressure tests can identify small leaks before they become major. Listen for hissing sounds at valves. Check meter readings when system should be off. Dying plants in one zone may indicate a leak depriving them of water. We offer leak detection services using specialized equipment. Even small leaks waste thousands of gallons annually - prompt repair pays dividends.</p>

                    <p>Our standard service area includes NYC and surrounding counties within a 50-mile radius of Manhattan. Locations beyond this may incur travel fees. Some remote areas have minimum service requirements. We occasionally adjust coverage based on technician availability and seasonality. Commercial accounts may have different coverage terms. Temporary service expansions sometimes occur for special projects. Check our website for current coverage maps. We're happy to recommend qualified providers for areas we don't serve. Expansion plans are reviewed annually.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>While we specialize in irrigation, we partner with organic landscapers who handle fertilization and pest control. Our systems can deliver organic amendments through fertigation when properly designed. We prioritize water solutions that support organic practices like drought-resistant plantings. Smart irrigation reduces runoff that could carry chemicals. Many organic farms use our precise watering systems. We can recommend organic-compatible products for system maintenance. Our designs support healthy soil ecosystems essential for organic growing. Ask about our sustainable irrigation options.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>We design for maximum energy efficiency through proper pump sizing, zoning, and scheduling. Variable frequency drives optimize pump operation. Solar-powered controllers are available. Low-voltage systems minimize electricity use. Proper design reduces pump runtime significantly. We calculate lifecycle energy costs for commercial projects. Newer technologies like DC-powered valves further reduce consumption. Energy audits identify savings opportunities. Efficient systems often qualify for utility rebates. Proper maintenance maintains efficiency over time. Well-designed irrigation can be one of your landscape's most energy-efficient systems.</p>

                    <p>Emergency repairs are typically addressed within 24 hours, with many same-day responses when reported by 12pm. Standard repair requests are scheduled within 3-5 business days in season. Maintenance contract customers receive priority scheduling with most repairs completed within 48 hours. Response times may vary during peak seasons (May-August) or extreme weather events. We provide arrival windows and technician notifications for all scheduled repairs. Critical issues affecting property or safety receive immediate attention regardless of contract status.</p>
