                        <p>We use security cookies to authenticate users, prevent fraudulent use of login credentials, and protect user data from unauthorized parties. For example, we may use cookies that allow us to identify your device for login authentication purposes. These cookies are essential for the security of our website and services.</p>

                        <p>To ensure our website remains available and responsive, we may use load balancing cookies that help distribute user traffic across multiple servers. These cookies don't store personal information but help optimize the performance and reliability of our website, especially during peak usage times.</p>

                        <p>Different cookies have different expiration periods. Session cookies expire when you close your browser. Persistent cookies have varying lifespans ranging from a few days to several years. We set expiration periods based on the purpose of the cookie - essential cookies may have longer durations while analytics cookies typically expire after a shorter period.</p>

                        <p>Cookies are stored in your web browser's storage space. Each browser manages this storage differently. Modern browsers typically allow you to see what cookies are stored, delete specific cookies, or block cookies from specific sites. The storage capacity for cookies is limited (usually around 4KB per cookie) and browsers may impose limits on the total number of cookies stored.</p>

                        <p>We implement several security measures for our cookies. Secure cookies are transmitted over encrypted HTTPS connections. HttpOnly cookies cannot be accessed by client-side scripts, reducing cross-site scripting risks. SameSite cookie attributes help protect against cross-site request forgery attacks. We regularly review cookie security as part of our overall website security assessments.</p>

                        <p>We conduct regular cookie audits to ensure our cookie usage remains compliant with privacy regulations and aligned with our privacy commitments. These audits review all cookies set by our website, their purposes, durations, and the data they collect. Based on audit findings, we may remove unnecessary cookies or adjust their settings to enhance privacy protection.</p>

This means we obtain clear consent before setting non-essential cookies, provide detailed information about cookie usage, and make it easy for users to withdraw consent.

                        <p>Most cookies we use don't directly identify individuals. However, when combined with other information (like account login details), cookie data could become personally identifiable. We minimize this risk by keeping different data types separate where possible and applying appropriate security measures to all personal data processing.</p>
